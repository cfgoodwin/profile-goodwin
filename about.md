<p class="message">
  Throughout my four years at Iowa, I have deeloped a storng understanding of journalism and PR, political science, and entreprenuership. I have also been given multiple opportunites to put these learned skills to the test through a number of diverse internships. Based on this, I feel confident and well prepared to enter into the workforce and find a company I am passionate about. 
  
  As a PR specialist or marketer, or wherever else my career takes me, I will dedicate my very best work to the company and team I am with while ensuring that I am carrying out our values in all my work.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).
