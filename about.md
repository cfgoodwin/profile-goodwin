<p class="message">
  Throughout my four years at Iowa, I have developed a storng understanding of journalism and PR, political science, and entreprenuership. I have also been given opportunites to put these learned skills to the test through a number of diverse internships. Based on this, I feel confident and well prepared to enter into the workforce and find a company I am passionate about.

As a PR specialist or marketer, or wherever else my career takes me, I will dedicate my very best work to the company and team I am with while ensuring that I am carrying out our values in all my work. 

Some of my personal characteristics I incorporate into my work efforts include being dependable, creative, organized, and strategic in my planning. I have found success in being a project manager and take strides to demonstrate leadership in all cases that apply. 


Some specific expereinces that give me unique value include:

* Using Adobe Creative Suite in class and internships, creating real marketing materials for a corporation
* Numerous leadership experiences and serving on exec boards, driving marketing and recruitment efforts
* Created, developed, and increased traffic for several companies and social media platforms
* Devlopment of project management skills through execution of company-wide communicaitons and event planning for corporate sponsorship events
